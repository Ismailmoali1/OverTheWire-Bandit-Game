# OverTheWire: Bandit — My Notes (Levels 1–15)

These are my personal notes and findings from completing the Bandit wargame.  
I focused on identifying what each challenge teaches and the exact commands used.

---

## Level 1

**Task:**  
List the files in the directory and read the `readme` file.

**Commands Used:**
```bash
ls
cat readme
Password:

Level 2
Task:
The file is named -, so it must be accessed using a relative path.

Commands Used:

bash
Copy code
./-
Password:

perl
Copy code

If you want, I can continue Levels 3–15 in the same format—just send the raw text!
